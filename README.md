# Klipper Config+Tooling+Prusa Menus

This repo contains some examples of configuration files to use with Klipper firmware

printer.cfg : Configuration example file for a Creality CR10sPro
printer_macros.cfg : Extends with new macros missing GCodes in Klipper
printer_menu.cfg : Adds new menu entry points, similar in structure to those of Prusa for Klipper firmware (It is still under development).
